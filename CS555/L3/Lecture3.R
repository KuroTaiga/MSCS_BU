## Compute confidence intervals for population 
## mean with given conditions
## Call Center example
## Assume that population ùúé = 15 minutes and
## sample mean of the wait times is x_bar = 30.9 minutes.
## The parameter of interest is the population mean, ùúá.

#Compute z*
ConfLevel <- 0.99 #Define confidence level
LeftTail <- ConfLevel+(1-ConfLevel)/2
zStar <- qnorm(LeftTail)

#Compute margin of error given
n <- 100
sigma <- 15
MarginError <- zStar*sigma/sqrt(n)

#Compute lower and upper limits of the confidence interval 
#using sample mean = 55
(Lower <- 30.9-MarginError)
(Upper <- 30.9+MarginError)

?one.sample.z
# Read the documentation and make sure you understand it. 
# Provides a one-sample hypothesis test. 
# The test assumes that the underlying population is normal and 
# furthermore that the population standard deviation is known.

# Samples from 50 water sources throughout the county are taken and 
# the levels of this chemical are measured. 
# They are interested in testing the following hypotheses:

# H0: mu=15 (the mean level of the chemical is normal)
# H1: mu != 15 (the mean level of the chemical is abnormal)
# Suppose we know that the population standard deviation is 6.2. 
# The sample mean fromthe 50 samples was 16.4 ppm.
# Calculate the value of the test statistic and the associated p-value.

one.sample.z(null.mu = 15, xbar = 16.4, sigma = 6.2, 
             n = 50, alternative = "two.sided")
(zval <- (16.4-15)/(6.2/sqrt(50)))
# One sample z-test 
# z*            P-value
# 1.596693     0.1103342

# It appears that the sample mean that we observed 
# (xbar=16.4) is moderately likely to have occurred if the true
# population mean was 15 ppm (if mu=15). 
# This means we do not have strong evidence against the null hypothesis at 5% level.

##Critical value approach
1.5967 > qnorm(0.975)

##P value approach
##replicate p value
pnorm(1.597, lower.tail = F)*2
##compare p value with alpha level
0.11 < 0.05

##CI approach
ConfLevel <- 0.95 #Define confidence level
LeftTail <- ConfLevel+(1-ConfLevel)/2
zStar <- qnorm(LeftTail)

#Compute margin of error given
n <- 50
sigma <- 6.2
MarginError <- zStar*sigma/sqrt(n)

#Compute lower and upper limits of the confidence interval using sample mean = 55
(Lower <- 16.4-MarginError)
(Upper <- 16.4+MarginError)

#Exercise A
